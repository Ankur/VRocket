# VRocket
A minimalistic, 3D FPV virtual reality game for Google Cardboard.
Navigate through the barriers.

## Features
* Head tracking using the [DeviceOrientationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent)
* Full screen stereoscopic
* Uses SVG's and DOM's
* Built during the middle of finals week

## Help & FAQ
Q: Help!  I can't move side-to-side!

A: Moving side-to-side is disabled until the first barrier of the level is visible. 
   Just wait until you can see the barrier and you're good to go!
   
Q: The movement is really buggy!

A: Turn around 180Â° and restart the app.  Presto.
   (This is caused by the magnetometer's shift from 0 to 360 and isn't readable)
